# Thos
Thos is a little operating system I'm working on in my freetime.

# Installation
Thos had not been tested on real maschines only on virtual maschines.
To install Thos you have to run the Setup.sh script and then the run.sh script.
The Setup.sh takes around 15 minutes to install all compilers and stuff needed to compile Thos.
The run.sh script runs Thos in Qemu and also builds the program.

# Information
I DO NOT RECOMMEND USING THOS ON A REAL MASCHINE, because like i said i never testet it and
its barely able to boot. That means you have to write all programs youreself.

I think I need a couple of years to get Thos into the Position the release it.

# Plans
This project started beacause of educational purposes but then I decided to make it something bigger.
My plan is to make a lightweight operating system that runs on every maschine.
